I am a Research Assistant at the University of Hong Kong currently, with a Master’s in Health Data Science from the University of Manchester. My expertise spans clinical data analysis and biostatistics, including survival analysis, cross‐sectional and cohort study design, randomized controlled trials, causal inference, Mendelian Randomization, omics data analysis, and machine learning. With over a year of academic research experience, I am dedicated to applying data-driven approaches to advance healthcare outcomes.
